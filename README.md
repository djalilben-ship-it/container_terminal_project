## Proposed Solution or Model

* **High-level description**:

#  Container Terminal Equipment Dimensioning

This study estimates the **required number of quay cranes and trucks** to handle the expected throughput of the new container terminal at Oran Port.
Calculations are based on the **final terminal design (Design #4)** and on operational performance indicators.

---

##  Quay Cranes

### Method

[
N_{\text{cranes}} = \frac{Capacity}{Productivity \times Hours \times Ratio}
]

### Input Data

* Productivity: **30 containers/hour**
* Ratio 40‚Äô/20‚Äô: **1.5**
* Working time: **2250 hours/year**
* Target capacity: **500,000 containers/year**

### Result

[
N_{\text{cranes}} = \frac{500,000}{30 \times 2250 \times 1.5} \approx 5
]

 **5 quay cranes needed**

* Current: 2 cranes already available
* Additional: **3 cranes required**

**Allocation**

* Main quay: 4 cranes (2 per ship)
* Auxiliary quay: 1 crane

---

##  Internal Transport Trucks

### Method

* **Cycle Time**: loading + unloading + travel
* **Delivery Rate per Truck**:
  [
  R_{dv} = \frac{Available , Time}{Cycle , Time}
  ]
* **Number of Trucks**:
  [
  N_c = \frac{Daily , Demand}{Deliveries , per , Truck , per , Day}
  ]

### Input Data

* Loading/unloading: **45 s each**
* Speed: **25 km/h (6.9 m/s)**
* Avg distance: **73 m**
* Daily demand: **6000 containers**
* Availability: **85%**
* Operation: **3 shifts √ó 6 h = 18 h/day**

### Result

* Cycle time: **1.85 min**
* Deliveries per truck: **20/hour**
* Daily capacity per truck: **20 √ó 18 = 360 containers**
* Trucks required:
  [
  N_c = \frac{6000}{360} \approx 17
  ]

 **17 trucks needed**

* Current fleet: 10 trucks
* Additional: **7 trucks required**

---

##  Analysis & Strategic Value

* Investments should focus on **quay cranes** rather than yard cranes, as quay handling is the bottleneck.
* Increasing trucks from **10 ‚Üí 17** will reduce waiting queues significantly.
* Equipment sizing aligned with **international port standards** ensures efficiency, safety, and competitive advantage.
